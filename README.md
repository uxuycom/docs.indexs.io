# 沁 Overview

UXUY Indexer is the infrastructure of the inscription ecosystem and a standardized indexer that actively embraces Bitcoin and the spirit of  Satoshi. Provide developers with inscription services for Bitcoin Ordinals縲。RC20縲・TH縲。NB Chain縲、valanche縲￣olygon and other public chains and ecosystems. You can use the API to deploy your own inscription services, build inscription-adapted wallet applications, develop browsers, and more.&#x20;

UXUY Indexer is actively exploring new ways of playing inscriptions, realizing InFi through a new combination of inscription assets + Finance, and unleashing the full potential of inscriptions.

## Our Mission

The development of inscription has spread to the multi-chain ecosystem. UXUY calls on inscription to embrace Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi and follow the DMT (Deploy, Mint, Transfer) Standard.&#x20;

As Mr. Satoshi mentioned in the Bitcoin [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf):&#x20;

_A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution_&#x20;

As "[UXUY Crypto Equity Manifesto](https://blog.uxuy.com/the-uxuy-crypto-equity-manifesto-97e0d0f7b612)" says: We firmly believe that trading is the only weapon that can break down barriers.

## Our Ecosystem

UXUY is actively exploring the multi-chain ecology of inscription and currently supports multiple public chains such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ETH, Avalanche and 200+ inscription protocols.&#x20;

Gradually improve the basic settings of inscription and explore the huge potential of the inscription track.

## Our Solutions

To actively build multi-chain inscription infrastructure, call for inscriptions to abide by DMT standards, and jointly explore more possibilities for inscription ecology.&#x20;

UXUY has made a series of efforts, including:

* UXUY APP supports inquiry, engraving, transfer, and multi-chain and multi-ecological inscription services ( Download [APP](https://uxuy.com/download) )&#x20;
* [UXUY](https://app.gitbook.com/o/KCzJiJ2iIEs4ytcyUPyK/s/8RjG9b3T8jxq2t0OOrIz/) official website launches multi-chain inscription signage&#x20;
* Online inscription browser

Coming soon:

* BRC20 inscription online&#x20;
* Launching a new combination of inscription Assets + Finance to realize InFi&#x20;
* Launched multi-chain inscription trading market (Marketplace + AMM)

## Why Indexer

We firmly believe that inscription is accelerating to become the third largest asset after Token and NFT. It relies on the new paradigm of "decentralized" asset issuance and has gained market recognition and popularity.

At present, the inscription market other than Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC20 is developing wildly in a "non-standardized" way, which runs counter to the original intention of Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto. This is something UXUY does not want to see.

At present, the inscription market other than Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC20 is developing wildly in a "non-standardized" way, which runs counter to the original intention of Bitcoin and the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto. This is something UXUY does not want to see.

Therefore, UXUY established a standardized indexer that embraces the spirit of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto to provide indexing services for the inscription track.
