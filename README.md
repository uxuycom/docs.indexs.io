# ðŸŽƒ Overview

UXUY Indexer is the infrastructure of the Inscription ecosystem and a standardized indexer that actively embraces Bitcoin and the spirit of  Satoshi. Provide developers with inscription services for Bitcoin Ordinals, BRC20, and ETH, BNB Chain, Avalanch, Pollygon and other public chains and ecosystems. You can use the API to deploy your own Inscription services, build Inscription-adapted wallet applications, develop browsers, and more.&#x20;

UXUY Indexer is actively exploring new ways of playing inscriptions, realizing InFi through a new combination of inscription assets + Finance, and unleashing the full potential of inscriptions.

## Our Mission

The development of Inscription has spread to the multi-chain ecosystem. UXUY calls on Inscription to embrace the spirit of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto and follow the DMT (Deploy, Mint, Transfer) Standard.&#x20;

As Mr. Satoshi mentioned in the Bitcoin [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf):&#x20;

_A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution_&#x20;

As "[UXUY Crypto Equity Mainfesto](https://blog.uxuy.com/the-uxuy-crypto-equity-manifesto-97e0d0f7b612)" says: We firmly believe that trading is the only weapon that can break down barriers.
