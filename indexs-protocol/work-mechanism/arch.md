# Arch

There are different blockchains, some is fast and some is normal.

for the fast chains, we need to process data fast, that is a challenge.

So We create a new model that is can let other indexer node work together.

It will be really POW.

we support the miner custom the endpoint for their blockchain node. custom the protocol list want to accept in their indexer.
