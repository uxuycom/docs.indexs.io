# Mechanism

Columbus Indexer is an opensource project based on UXUY Labs.

Since Inscriptions generate lots of data in the blockchain transaction, community found some solution to mine the data from blockchain.&#x20;

Firstly, the developer such as ordinals and unisat, okx use self indexer to get the data and computing the combine data in inscription data with the address.

so that we can extract the model&#x20;

$$f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \xi x}$$

&#x20;/code

```go
// Some code
struct address {
 address 
}
struct inscription {
 tick
 meta
 state
}

{address} do {tick } {state} on blockchain {block-height} {position-in-height}
 
so we can get the sequence by position-height and block-height.
we can get a tick collections filter by tick 
we can get a address collections filter by address
also we can filter by other fields.

```

At now, blockchain becomes a unmodified database for us, it can take low-cost, fair-mint to common people. that means there will be more better than before.



The gate opened thought won't be closed yet.  Columbus found the America, We use columbus named indexer to show our spirit that is we will make some different.
